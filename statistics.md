## Notes on Statistics

**Central Limit Theorem**
Central limit theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined mean and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed.

**Student's t-test**
A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t distribution if the null hypothesis is supported. It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other, and is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on the data, the test statistic (under certain conditions) follows a Student's t distribution.
